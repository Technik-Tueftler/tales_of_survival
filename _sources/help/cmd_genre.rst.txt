     - Description
   * - ``deactivate``
     - Subcommand to deactivate a genre. This can be helpful if you have an improvement for a genre or want to replace an existing genre with a **newer** one.
   * - ``activate``
     - Subcommand to activate a genre again. This can be helpful if you have deactivated a genre by mistake or want to use an **older** genre again.

.. important::
    It is not possible to create a duplicate genre where w, x, y, and z are the same. 
    One of the attributes must be different in order to create a new one. The 
    deactivated status does not change this rule.
